# A maze solver built using DFS algorithm in python

This repository contains a Python program that generates and solves mazes using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. It also features a graphical visualization of the solving process, implemented with the Pygame library.

## Features
- Solve the generated maze using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
- Visually display the solving process in a graphical window.
- Provide real-time visualization of visited cells during maze solving.

Thanks for visiting repo. 
Happy Coding !
