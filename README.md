# A Maze Solver Built Using DFT Algorithm In Python

This repository contains a Python program that generates random maze and solves it using Depth-First Traversal (DFT) algorithm. It also features a graphical visualization of the solving process, implemented with the Pygame library.

## Features
- Randomly generate Maze 
- Solve the generated maze using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
- Visually display the solving process in a graphical window.
- Provide real-time visualization of visited cells during maze solving.

Thanks for visiting Repo.
Happy Coding !!
